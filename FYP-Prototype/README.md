# FYP-Prototype
DISLCAINMER: Origial dataset is too large to host on github please contact me for the original wine reviews dataset. Or it can be taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews
----------------------------------------------------
My Prototype web application for my FYP.

Look at the CodeDeclaration.pdf for images of code relating to the below: 

- FLASK SERVER/ DASH CODE *Highlighted Code is not my own*
- All the code on the Jupyter Notebooks is my own. Although it does use SkLearn libraries to help to make a prediction.
-----------------------------------------------------
To run the Jupyter notebooks you must install Jupyter Notebooks onto your machine and then run Jupyter Notebooks from the command line and this will open your browser. You then clone the notebook code to your machine along with the datasets.

To run the Flask application server please clone the code to your machine, open your command line and 'cd' to the directory holding the app.py file. From here please enter 'python app.py' and copy and paste the local IP address it gives you into your browser.
